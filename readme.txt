##Recommended Update Process
1) Backup: Create a full backup of your website

== Styles and templates ==

You can override styles and change the layout of almost all the blocks that the plugin renders.

Override CSS:

Just use the CSS class names of blocks in your theme or custom CSS.
You can refer and use the sources: `wp-content/plugins/hostify-booking/src/sass/`

Override the plugin template files - you can use one of the following methods:

**1. Override with files placed in your current theme folder**

Just copy the files you need, keeping the nested directories, from directory:
```
wp-content/plugins/hostify-booking/tpl/*
```
to directory:
```
wp-content/themes/YOUR-ACTIVE-THEME-FOLDER/hostify-booking-templates/*
```

Do not copy files that you do not plan to change, so as not to complicate the work.

**2. Specify the path to the directory with templates to override in the plugin options**

Settings → Hostify Booking Engine → Admin options → Custom template path

**3. Use the WP filter**

In your custom code you can use the hfy_tpl_path filter. For example:
`
function my_custom_hfy_tpl_path($args) {
	// $args['file'] like '/www/website1/wp-content/plugins/hostify-booking/tpl/listing/listing-amenities.php'
	// $args['path'] like '/www/website1/wp-content/plugins/hostify-booking/tpl/'
	// $args['name'] like 'listing/listing-amenities'
    return '/home/user/my-path-to-templates/' . $args['name'] . '.php';
}

add_filter('hfy_tpl_path', 'my_custom_hfy_tpl_path');
`

So you can safely fix or change the necessary parts of the layout according to your needs
and not be afraid that updating the plugin will erase your changes.
